# ko's ChessDB

## Short info

This is a research/tryout project for Symfony 4.
Also, this is a database for chess games.

This is in development, do not expect a full featured, full working project!

## Getting started:

```bash
 git clone $REPOURL # clone the repository
 cd chessdb # or whatever you named the directory
 composer install # install deps
 ./vendor/bin/simple-phpunit # to run tests ;)
 
 ./bin/console server:start # to start server
```

Make sure, you have a least PHP7.1, sqLite and of course, composer installed.
At this point nothing more is required.
